# what is functional?
almost everything is functional, here are the exceptions

## Exeptions
The sleep, it is curious. because the first time you do not use in a power on it works perfect, but the second time it causes a restart of the computer. Personally it does not affect me because I do not use this function.

# System extremes
When it comes to virtualizing a system, it doesn't work as well as I would like it to, which is understandable since the hardware is not completely identical. But it has a completely usable performance
